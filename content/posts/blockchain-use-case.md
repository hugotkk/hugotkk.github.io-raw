# Trust Over IP: Hyperledger Ursa, Indy, and Aires

## Notes
* prove the credential without CA
* trusted issuer (eg: gov) issues the identity token (eg: driving license) -> send it to a crypto account (like sending btc to someone)
* on the blockchain, it shows a record that the account owns that license. (like you can check your btc balance / NFS on chain explorer)
* anyone can request that you own that account (like an approval transaction from dapp). You can decide to share your data to what extent 
* send the data to requester and it can be verified as it is signed by issuer
* blockchain is used to prove the ownership of your identities
* data can be stored off chain, sign it and verify with issuer's account
* hacking personal accounts become useless -> not cost effective, you can hack a single person each time
* stealing / leading personal data is useless -> no proof, no one will accept

# Comprehensive review of 21 use cases of Hyperledger

https://youtu.be/VQTARQSuUFU?t=1440

## Use cases (some are still in proof of concept)

1. end to end tracking (supply chain, different parties can participate eg: bank insurance company consultant retail...)
2.identity management - eg: allow 3rd parties to access your data with requests, prevent fraud, credit checking, hash your passport/fingerprint so you can verify it is your identity
3. contract automation- like promotion in company (HR), consultant contract
4. voting
5. tokenisations - cross parties reward program(asiamiles), assets management (use in trading, convert different kinds of assets like house stock cash to token)
6. immutable record- law enforcement investigation, accounting, credit check, insurance claim, medical history, law...

## IBM food trust
* safety
* sustainability
* cost optimization (inventory / transportation )
* tracking

## Tradelens -> (supply chain for trading)
* costs 1.8T / year -> potential saving ~10% costs

## IBM blockchain world wire
* world wire solution with blockchain
* use stellar protocol
