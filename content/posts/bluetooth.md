Transmit an electromagnetic wave (binary) with different wavelength 

eg:
121mm = 1
124mm = 0

the waves send in all directions

Bluetooth range: 2.4835GHz - 2.4GHz

Divided in different sections (79 channels), each section has a pair of wavelengths representing 0 and 1

the bluetooth range is shared with some other device like a microwave oven

like the power of a microwave oven is too large for bluetooth. 

it may destroy the bluetooth device if you put them inside the microwave oven (danger)

# Data Integrity

## Packet

* Access Codes (72 bits)
* Header (54bits)
* Payload (vary, depends on the function)

## Frequency Hopping

Two bluetooth devices will have a set of channels to send data

They will change the channels frequently

## Error Detection

## Noise Filtering

# Data Transmit

## Frequency Shift Keying

carrier wave adjusts the wavelength to send 0 and 1

## Phase Shift Keying

constant wavelength and attitude

use the wave function to determine 0 and 1 (like sin x = 0, cos x = 1, instead of A sin x and B sin X)
