Trasnit electimagetic wave (binary) with different wavelength 

eg:
121mm = 1
124mm = 0

the wave send in all directional

Bluetooth range: 2.4835GHz - 2.4GHz

Devided in different section (79 channels), each section has a pair of wavelength representing 0 and 1

the bluetooth range are shared with some other device like microwave oven

like the power of microwave oven is too large to bluetooth. 

it may distory the bluetooth device if you put them inside the microwave own (danger)

# Data Integrity

# Packet

* Access Codes (72bits)
* Header (54bits)
* Payload (vary, depends on the function)

# Frequency Hopping

Two bluetooth devices will have a set of channels to send data

They will change the channels frequently

## Error Detection

## Noise Filtering

# Data Transmit

## Frequency Shift Keying

carrier wave adjusts the wavelength to send 0 and 1

## Phase Shift Keying

constant wavelength and attitude

use the wave function to determine 0 and 1 (like sin x = 0, cos x = 1, instead of A sin x and B sin X)
