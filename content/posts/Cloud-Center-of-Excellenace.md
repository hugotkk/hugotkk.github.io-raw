* introduction - Cloud Centre of Excellence is a team that can help the organisation for cloud adoption
* role & responsible
* characteristic for the team member
* best practice

# Characteristic

* driving the organisation forward
* has ability to stand up - open-minded
* be confident why and how to do it - clear minded / big picture thinkers
* diverse and cross-functional

# Skill Set

* Cost management
* Project Management (Transparent)
* Cloud operation engineer (CI/CD)
* Data engineer (new currency, capture data from IoT, video stream)
* Application
* Security (IAM, Policy, Firewall)

# Best Practise

* Keep passion & excitement
* Start small (5-7 ppl in a team)
* Rotate people (training)
* Communication
* Scaling and reorganising
* Think of the failover and backup plan
* Cloud training for organisation
* Bill, cost optimization
* Empower the team (courage them trying new role, new service, bleeding-edge tech)
* Gain transparency (everyone knows the progress...why you do that...)


# Notes

* cloud makes anything as code -> code makes things more transparent -> the complexity of the project is reduced
* many jobs can be automated through cloud and they are automatically documented as code
* is it possible to create a roadmap / resources library for the whole organisation (like AWS workshop)? - everybody can gear up the knowledge through videos / materials
* follow the framework and make planing...like scaling...we can plan it on the first day when starting the business
