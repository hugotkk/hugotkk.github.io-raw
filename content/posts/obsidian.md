I found this markdown software when watching [this video](https://youtu.be/48RXD_jOwu8?t=328)

I am interested in that map and think if I can organise my markdown notes with it.

* most of the features do not attract to me
* Will prefer organising the notes with tags not folder
* Spacemacs is better for editing. Happy with marco, fuzzy file searching, find and replace, vim keybinding and git
* Template function (like marco)
* Use to preview and visualise my notes but not editing
* Graph view support tags to virtualize the notes so no need to refactor my Hugo notes (Graph View > Filters > Tags)
