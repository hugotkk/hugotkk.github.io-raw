AWS logs' default interface can be challenging to navigate for in-depth analysis. Amazon Athena can help address two common issues.

First, CloudTrail logs' default filters can be limiting. However, with Athena, you can use SQL to apply filters to each log field, allowing for more detailed analysis and improved insights.

Second, while CloudWatch Logs Insights is useful for log analysis, it lacks user-friendly options for exporting reports or searching historical data. Athena can help with this as well.

To get started with Athena, follow these steps:
- To query CloudTrail logs using Athena, refer to [Setting up CloudTrail Logs with Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/cloudtrail-logs.html).
- To query CloudWatch logs using Athena and connectors, check out [Setting up CloudWatch Logs Connector for Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connectors-cloudwatch.html).
